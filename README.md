# Graphene-U-Net

## Abstract

Graphene-U-Net is a library that offers simple and easy to use functions for training and evaluating Neural Networks for Segmentation of microscopy images using the U-Net Architecture. The library is based on an implementation of U-Net in the PyTorch deep Llarning framework, and uses OpenCV/Numpy for the data handling as well as Scikit-learn for the evaluation metrics. It contains functions for loading the dataset, training using k fold cross validation, and inferring the network on new data.
